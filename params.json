{"name":"Proper SSL","tagline":"SSL ... Done right!","body":"# Proper SSL\r\nProper SSL is a repository of examples of how to properly setup SSL connections as both a client and server.\r\n\r\n### About\r\nThe idea for Proper SSL came about when looking for good examples for setting up SSL on nginx (specifically how to set it up for PFS using ECDHE). The idea was then expanded to include other client/server setups which should be correctly using SSL such as database clients and servers.\r\n\r\n### Format\r\nEach repository contains a specific self-contained example of how to properly setup and use an SSL connection. The objective isn't to create the most extensible SSL examples, it's simply to have a cheat sheet to look at for the right way of doing things. Whenever possible external dependencies should be minimized.\r\n\r\nEach example should preferably be runnable. Given the client/server nature of most of these examples the preferred approach is to define the test server using Vagrant so that new users can try things out with a simple `vagrant up`.\r\n\r\nAny additional steps needed to run the example should be in the example's `README` file.\r\n\r\n### Repo Naming Conventions - Clients Connecting To Servers\r\nExamples of clients securely connecting to servers should be named in the following format:\r\n\r\n    [language]-[interface/framework]-[target]\r\n\r\n\r\n * `language` is the programming language used (eg java, ruby, python).\r\n * `interface/framework` is the framework used (eg jdbc, sqlalchemy, datamapper, dbi).\r\n * `target` is the target that is being connected to. This will usually be an external server (eg postgresql, mysql)\r\n\r\nUnless there's a good reason for it don't add \"ssl\" to the name of the repo.\r\n\r\n### Repo Naming Conventions - Server Configurations\r\nExamples of server configurations should be named in the following format:\r\n\r\n    [server-name]-[description]\r\n\r\n\r\n* `server-name` is the name of the server program (eg nginx, apache2, mysql)\r\n* `description` is a short description about what's being configured (eg pfs-ecdhe)\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\nHere are links to a couple of the examples:\r\n * https://github.com/properssl/nginx-pfs\r\n * https://github.com/properssl/java-jdbc-postgresql\r\n\r\n### License\r\nUnless explicitly specified otherwise, all Proper SSL code is release under the MIT License.\r\n\r\n### Who Created This?\r\nProper SSL is brought to you by the creators of [JackDB].\r\n\r\n[JackDB]: http://www.jackdb.com/home.html?utm_source=properssl\r\n","google":"UA-42106876-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
