{"name":"Proper SSL","tagline":"SSL Best Practices","body":"# Proper SSL\r\nProper SSL is a series of best practices for establishing SSL connections between clients and servers.\r\n\r\n### About\r\nExamples of using SSL found across the web are frequently incomplete or insecure. Proper SSL aims to make it easier to follow best practices by providing a series of complete example configurations for establishing SSL connections in the most popular client/server environments.\r\n\r\n### Format\r\nEach repository contains a self-contained example of how to properly establish and use an SSL connection. The objective isn't to create the most extensible SSL examples but to have a cheat sheet of the right way to do things. Whenever possible, external dependencies should be minimized.\r\n\r\nEach example is runnable. Given their client/server nature, the preferred way is to define a test server using [Vagrant] so that new users can run tests with a simple `vagrant up` command.\r\n\r\nAny additional steps needed to run an example should be in its `README` file.\r\n\r\n### Repo Naming Conventions - Clients\r\nExamples of clients securely connecting to servers should be named in the following format:\r\n\r\n    [language]-[interface/framework]-[target]\r\n\r\n * `language` is the programming language used (eg. java, ruby, python).\r\n * `interface/framework` is the framework used (eg. jdbc, sqlalchemy, datamapper, dbi).\r\n * `target` is the server being connected to. This will usually be an external server (eg. postgresql, mysql).\r\n\r\nUnless there's a good reason, don't add \"ssl\" to the name of the repo.\r\n\r\n### Repo Naming Conventions - Servers\r\nExamples of server configurations should be named in the following format:\r\n\r\n    [server-name]-[description]\r\n\r\n* `server-name` is the name of the server used (eg. nginx, apache2, mysql).\r\n* `description` is a short description about what's being configured (eg. pfs).\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n * [nginx with Perfect Forward Security](https://github.com/properssl/nginx-pfs)\r\n * [PostgreSQL JDBC with self-signed certificate validation](https://github.com/properssl/java-jdbc-postgresql)\r\n * [MariaDB JDBC with self-signed certificate validation](https://github.com/properssl/java-jdbc-mariadb)\r\n\r\n### License\r\nUnless explicitly specified otherwise, all Proper SSL code is released under the [MIT License].\r\n\r\n### Who Created Proper SSL?\r\nProper SSL is brought to you by [JackDB].\r\n\r\n[JackDB]: http://www.jackdb.com/home.html?utm_source=properssl\r\n[Vagrant]: http://www.vagrantup.com/\r\n[MIT LICENSE]: http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT","google":"UA-42106876-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
